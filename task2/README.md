# Task 2

Create a Lambda that uses the code in `demo.py`. You do not need to add a trigger.

You will need to supply an IAM role to allow the Lambda to write logs to Cloudwatch. You might be able to use a role or policies that exist already in your sandbox account.

You can check that the Lambda has been created by looking in the browser. You can trigger the Lambda in the console by creating a dummy test event.
