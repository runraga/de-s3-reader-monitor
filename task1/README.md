# Task 1

Use Terraform to create an S3 bucket with a name of your choice (remembering it must be unique). You should also ensure that Terraform copies the file `test_file.txt` into the bucket.

The `provider.tf` file is complete, but you will need to complete the resources in `s3.tf`. Use the Terraform documentation to guide you.

Check that it has worked using an AWS CLI command and then using the browser.
